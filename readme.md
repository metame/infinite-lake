# Two Buckets

## Premise
Generalizing the classic logic problem (popularized by Die Hard 3): Given an infinite lake and two buckets of fixed size (e.g. 3L & 5L), how can you get a specific amount of water (e.g. 4L)?

## Code
A CLI file is included, runnable with Node.js.  Simply `node basicjs.js 4 5 3` passing 3 integer parameters (target, bucket1, bucket2).

The browser version is built with Angular and main page can be found at `/app/index.html`.  
To access from the browser reliably, run `npm install` then `node server`.
The app will be run on `localhost:8080/`.
